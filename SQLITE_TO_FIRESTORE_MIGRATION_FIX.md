# SQLite to Firestore Migration Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The error "no such table: assessments" occurred because the app was still trying to use the old SQLite database while the new Firestore implementation was in place. This created a conflict between the two database systems.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The application had both SQLite (`lib/db.ts`) and Firestore (`lib/firestore.ts`) implementations, and several files were still importing from the old SQLite database:

1. **`app/(app)/review.tsx`** - Using `saveAssessmentWithDefect` from SQLite
2. **Settings files** - Using `clearAllData` and `listAssessments` from SQLite  
3. **Export/Import** - Designed for SQLite database structure
4. **App configuration** - Still included `expo-sqlite` plugin

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed SQLite Imports
**Files Updated:**
- `app/(app)/review.tsx` - Removed SQLite import (already using FirestoreService)
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Replaced with FirestoreService
- `app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/settings.tsx` - Replaced with FirestoreService
- `lib/exportImport.ts` - Disabled SQLite-based export/import

### 2. Added Firestore Data Management Methods
**File:** `lib/firestore.ts`

**New Methods:**
```typescript
// Clear user's own data (staff users)
static async clearUserData(userId: string): Promise<void>

// Clear all system data (admin users only)  
static async clearAllSystemData(): Promise<void>
```

### 3. Updated Settings Functionality
**Staff Settings (`app/(app)/(tabs)/settings.tsx`):**
- Now uses `FirestoreService.listAssessments(user.uid)` for user's own data
- "Clear My Data" button uses `FirestoreService.clearUserData(user.uid)`
- Only clears the current user's assessments

**Admin Settings (`app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/settings.tsx`):**
- Now uses `FirestoreService.listAllAssessments()` for system-wide data
- "Clear All System Data" button uses `FirestoreService.clearAllSystemData()`
- Can clear all assessments from all users (admin privilege)

### 4. Disabled Export/Import Temporarily
**File:** `lib/exportImport.ts`
- Added helpful error messages explaining the migration
- Export/import functions now throw informative errors
- TODO: Will be updated to work with Firestore in future version

### 5. Removed SQLite Plugin
**File:** `app.json`
- Removed `"expo-sqlite"` from plugins array
- Eliminates SQLite dependency completely

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Clear App Data
1. **Uninstall and reinstall the app** to clear any existing SQLite database
2. **Or clear app data** in device settings

### Step 2: Test Basic Functionality
1. **Sign in** to the app
2. **Create an assessment** - should work without SQLite errors
3. **View dashboard** - should show assessments from Firestore
4. **Navigate between screens** - no database errors

### Step 3: Test Settings
1. **Staff User:**
   - Go to Settings
   - Check data count (should show user's assessments)
   - Test "Clear My Data" (should only clear user's data)

2. **Admin User:**
   - Go to Admin Settings  
   - Check data count (should show all system assessments)
   - Test "Clear All System Data" (should clear all data)

### Step 4: Test Export/Import
1. **Try export** - should show helpful error message
2. **Try import** - should show helpful error message
3. **Verify** other functionality still works

## 🔄 Migration Benefits

### Before (SQLite + Firestore Conflict):
- ❌ "no such table: assessments" errors
- ❌ Data inconsistency between SQLite and Firestore
- ❌ Role-based access control not working properly
- ❌ Admin dashboard couldn't load data

### After (Pure Firestore):
- ✅ No database table errors
- ✅ Consistent data storage in Firestore
- ✅ Role-based access control working
- ✅ Admin dashboard loads system-wide data
- ✅ Staff users see only their own data
- ✅ Proper user isolation and security

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### Staff Users:
- Can only view/clear their own assessments
- Cannot access other users' data
- Proper data isolation enforced

### Admin Users:
- Can view all assessments from all users
- Can clear all system data (with confirmation)
- Full administrative oversight

## 📝 Files Modified

### Core Database Migration:
- `app/(app)/review.tsx` - Removed SQLite import
- `lib/firestore.ts` - Added data management methods

### Settings Updates:
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Staff settings with user data only
- `app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/settings.tsx` - Admin settings with system data

### Configuration:
- `app.json` - Removed expo-sqlite plugin
- `lib/exportImport.ts` - Disabled SQLite-based features

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with both staff and admin users
2. **Verify Firebase security rules** are properly deployed
3. **Monitor for any remaining SQLite references**
4. **Plan Firestore-based export/import** for future version

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

### Export/Import (Future Version):
- Export assessments from Firestore to CSV/JSON
- Import assessments directly to Firestore
- Maintain role-based access during import/export

### Performance Optimizations:
- Add Firestore indexes for better query performance
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Add caching for frequently accessed data

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you still see SQLite errors:
1. **Clear app data** completely
2. **Check for any remaining SQLite imports** in your code
3. **Verify Firebase configuration** is correct
4. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages

### If data doesn't load:
1. **Check Firebase security rules** are deployed
2. **Verify user authentication** is working
3. **Check network connectivity** to Firebase
4. **Review console logs** for permission errors

The migration is now complete and the app should work entirely with Firestore, providing proper role-based access control and eliminating SQLite conflicts.
