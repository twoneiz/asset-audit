# Role-Based Access Control Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system implemented for the Asset Audit application.

## Overview

The RBAC system provides two distinct user roles with different permissions and access levels:

- **Staff Role**: Can capture images, create assessments, and view only their own data
- **Admin Role**: Can view all assessments, manage users, and access administrative features

## Implementation Details

### 1. User Profile and Role Management

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `lib/firestore.ts` - Extended with user profile management
- `lib/auth/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with role-based authentication

**Features:**
- User profile data model with role assignment
- Firestore service methods for user management
- Role-based user creation and updates
- Admin user management capabilities

### 2. Role-Based Authentication Context

**Files Created:**
- `lib/auth/RoleGuard.tsx` - Role-based component protection
- `lib/auth/RouteProtection.tsx` - Route-level access control

**Features:**
- Extended AuthContext with role checking utilities
- Component-level access control guards
- Route protection based on user roles
- Automatic role-based navigation

### 3. Admin Dashboard and Navigation

**Files Created:**
- `app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Admin navigation structure
- `app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/index.tsx` - Admin dashboard
- `app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/all-assessments.tsx` - All assessments view
- `app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/users.tsx` - User management interface
- `app/(app)/(admin-tabs)/settings.tsx` - Admin settings

**Features:**
- Comprehensive admin dashboard with system metrics
- All assessments view with filtering and search
- User management with role assignment capabilities
- Admin-specific navigation and UI elements

### 4. Role-Based Data Access Control

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/firestore.ts` - Added admin data access methods
- Firebase Security Rules (documented in `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md`)

**Features:**
- Staff users can only access their own assessments
- Admin users can access all assessments from all users
- Proper data isolation at the database level
- Role-based Firestore security rules

### 5. Updated Navigation and UI

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Staff navigation with role protection
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Staff dashboard with role indicators
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/settings.tsx` - Enhanced settings with user profile
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/capture.tsx` - Protected with role guards
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/assess.tsx` - Protected with role guards
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Simplified with route protection

**Features:**
- Role-specific navigation tabs
- Role indicators in user interface
- Protected capture and assessment functionality
- Enhanced user profile display

### 6. Enhanced User Registration

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx` - Added role selection during registration

**Features:**
- Role selection during user registration
- Role-specific onboarding flow
- Automatic redirection based on selected role
- Clear role descriptions for users

### 7. Security and Access Control

**Files Created:**
- `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md` - Comprehensive security rules documentation
- `RBAC_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing scenarios and validation

**Features:**
- Firebase Firestore security rules for role-based access
- Firebase Storage security rules for image access
- Component-level access control
- Route-level protection
- Comprehensive security documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Firebase Security Rules**: Update Firestore and Storage rules in Firebase Console
2. **Test Implementation**: Follow the testing guide to validate all functionality
3. **Create Test Users**: Set up test accounts for both staff and admin roles
4. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure role-based queries perform well with larger datasets
5. **User Training**: Provide documentation for end users on role-specific features

## Maintenance Considerations

- **User Role Changes**: Admins can modify user roles through the user management interface
- **Security Updates**: Regularly review and update Firebase security rules
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor query performance as user base grows
- **Feature Expansion**: New features should respect the established role-based architecture

## Support and Troubleshooting

Refer to:
- `RBAC_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for testing scenarios and common issues
- `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md` for security rule configuration
- Firebase Console for monitoring and debugging
- Application logs for authentication and authorization issues

The implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly role-based access control system that maintains the existing functionality while adding comprehensive administrative capabilities.
